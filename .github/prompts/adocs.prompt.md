Systematically audit ALL documentation in docs/ AND README.md against the actual codebase implementation through STATIC ANALYSIS ONLY, then MAKE ALL NECESSARY CHANGES to ensure 100% accuracy. DO NOT EXECUTE ANY CODE - perform all validation by reading and analyzing the codebase.

**AUDIT AND FIX PROCESS (NO CODE EXECUTION):**

1. **README.md Validation and Updates**
   - Read the project description and UPDATE it to accurately reflect what the codebase actually does
   - Analyze installation instructions against pyproject.toml and FIX any incorrect steps or missing dependencies
   - Examine all quick start examples by reading the code and CORRECT any that wouldn't work with current implementation
   - REVIEW prerequisites against actual code requirements and UPDATE as needed
   - STUDY all usage examples against current API/CLI interfaces and FIX outdated syntax
   - VALIDATE and REPAIR all external links and references

2. **API Documentation Corrections**
   - Compare endpoint descriptions with ingenious/api/routes/ by reading the route files and UPDATE all inaccuracies
   - FIX HTTP methods, request/response schemas, and status codes to match FastAPI definitions found in code
   - CORRECT parameter documentation to match actual function signatures by examining the code
   - UPDATE authentication requirements to reflect implemented middleware by reading dependencies.py and auth files
   - REPAIR example requests/responses to use current API schemas by analyzing the Pydantic models

3. **Configuration Documentation Fixes**
   - Audit docs/configuration/ against ingenious/config/settings.py and config.py by reading these files, then MAKE CORRECTIONS
   - UPDATE environment variable documentation to match what code actually reads by analyzing the config classes
   - FIX profiles.yml and config.yml examples to match Pydantic models exactly by examining the model definitions
   - CORRECT optional vs required field documentation based on actual validation logic found in the code
   - UPDATE dependency group documentation to match pyproject.toml optional-dependencies by reading the file

4. **Workflow Documentation Updates**
   - Cross-reference docs/workflows/ with ingenious/services/chat_services/ by reading the workflow implementations and MAKE CORRECTIONS
   - UPDATE workflow names, configuration requirements, and dependencies to match implementation by analyzing the code
   - FIX example payloads to match actual ChatRequest/ChatResponse models by examining the model definitions
   - CORRECT setup instructions based on real workflow requirements found in the code
   - UPDATE curl examples with correct endpoints and current JSON schemas by reading the API route definitions

5. **CLI Documentation Corrections**
   - Compare docs/CLI_REFERENCE/ with ingenious/cli/ by reading the CLI modules and UPDATE all discrepancies
   - FIX command names, arguments, options, and help text to match typer implementation by analyzing the CLI code
   - CORRECT command examples by reading what the commands actually do in the code
   - UPDATE environment variable requirements to match actual usage by examining the CLI implementations
   - FIX installation and setup steps based on current process by reading the project structure

6. **Architecture Documentation Updates**
   - EXAMINE architecture diagrams against actual code structure by reading the codebase and UPDATE if needed
   - FIX component descriptions to match actual class/module responsibilities by analyzing the code organization
   - UPDATE data flow diagrams to reflect current request/response handling by reading the API and service code
   - CORRECT technology stack documentation to match pyproject.toml dependencies by reading the dependency list

7. **Troubleshooting Guide Fixes**
   - ANALYZE troubleshooting steps against actual error handling code and FIX incorrect solutions
   - UPDATE error messages to match actual application output by reading exception handling code
   - EXAMINE solution steps by reading the code to understand what would resolve problems and CORRECT if needed
   - FIX diagnostic commands by reading CLI implementations to verify they exist and work as described

**STATIC ANALYSIS APPROACH:**

- **READ** all source code files to understand actual implementation
- **EXAMINE** configuration files, models, and schemas to understand data structures
- **ANALYZE** import statements and dependencies to understand system architecture
- **STUDY** error handling patterns to understand what errors actually occur
- **REVIEW** CLI implementations to understand available commands and options
- **INSPECT** API route definitions to understand endpoints and schemas

**MANDATORY CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT:**

- **ADD missing documentation** for features that exist in code but aren't documented
- **REMOVE outdated documentation** for features that no longer exist in the codebase
- **CORRECT all inaccurate information** where docs don't match implementation
- **UPDATE all examples** to use current API versions and schemas based on code analysis
- **FIX all broken internal links** between documentation sections
- **STANDARDIZE formatting** to ensure consistent documentation style
- **SYNCHRONIZE redundant information** between README.md and docs/

**SPECIFIC FILES TO UPDATE:**

- README.md (complete revision if needed)
- docs/configuration/
- docs/workflows/
- docs/CLI_REFERENCE/
- docs/architecture/
- docs/troubleshooting/
- Any other documentation files that contain inaccuracies

**CREATE AND UPDATE FILES:**

1. **UPDATE** existing documentation files to fix all identified discrepancies
2. **CREATE** missing documentation for undocumented features
3. **DELETE** or mark deprecated any documentation for removed features
4. **GENERATE** docs/AUDIT_REPORT.md documenting all changes made

Quality validation through static analysis only:
1. CREATE tests/docs/test_documentation_accuracy.py that could validate key documentation claims (but do not run it)
2. VERIFY documented API examples match route definitions by reading the code
3. CONFIRM CLI help text matches documentation by reading CLI module implementations
4. VALIDATE configuration examples match Pydantic models by reading model definitions
5. CHECK internal links reference files that actually exist in the repository
6. CONFIRM code examples use correct syntax by reading current API/CLI implementations
7. VERIFY README.md quick start guide steps match actual project structure and requirements
