Deeply analyze and understand the entire codebase to build comprehensive context for answering any questions about the project.

**Complete Codebase Mapping:**
1. **Project Structure Analysis**: Read and understand the complete directory structure, file organization, and architectural patterns
2. **Entry Points**: Identify all application entry points (main files, CLI commands, web endpoints, etc.)
3. **Core Components**: Map out all major modules, classes, functions, and their relationships
4. **Data Flow**: Trace how data moves through the system from input to output
5. **Dependencies**: Understand all internal and external dependencies, imports, and module relationships

**Business Logic & Domain Understanding:**
1. **Purpose & Functionality**: Understand what the application does, its main features and use cases
2. **Domain Models**: Identify all data structures, entities, and business objects
3. **Workflows**: Map out all major business processes and user journeys
4. **APIs & Interfaces**: Document all public interfaces, endpoints, and interaction points
5. **Configuration**: Understand all configuration files, environment variables, and settings

**Technical Implementation Details:**
1. **Frameworks & Libraries**: Identify all technologies, frameworks, and third-party libraries used
2. **Design Patterns**: Recognize architectural patterns, design patterns, and coding conventions
3. **Error Handling**: Understand error handling strategies and exception flows
4. **Security Implementation**: Identify authentication, authorization, and security measures
5. **Performance Considerations**: Note caching, optimization techniques, and performance patterns

**Development & Operations Context:**
1. **Build System**: Understand build processes, compilation, and deployment workflows
2. **Testing Strategy**: Analyze test structure, coverage, and testing approaches
3. **Documentation**: Review all README files, comments, and documentation
4. **Git History**: Understand recent changes, development patterns, and evolution
5. **CI/CD**: Analyze automation, deployment, and development workflows

**Code Quality & Maintainability:**
1. **Code Style**: Understand coding conventions, formatting, and style guidelines
2. **Modularity**: Assess how code is organized into reusable components
3. **Complexity**: Identify complex areas that may need special attention
4. **Coupling**: Understand how different parts of the system interact

**Database & Storage:**
1. **Data Models**: Understand database schema, tables, relationships if applicable
2. **Storage Patterns**: Identify how data is stored, retrieved, and managed
3. **Migrations**: Review database migrations and schema evolution

**Integration Points:**
1. **External Services**: Identify all external API calls, third-party integrations
2. **File I/O**: Understand file handling, uploads, downloads, and processing
3. **Network Communication**: Analyze HTTP clients, websockets, or other network protocols

**Build Comprehensive Mental Model:**
- Create a complete mental map of the codebase architecture
- Understand the "why" behind implementation decisions
- Identify key abstractions and their purposes
- Map out control flow for major operations
- Understand the relationship between different layers and components

**Prepare for Q&A:**
After this analysis, be ready to answer questions about:
- How specific features work
- Where to find particular functionality
- How to modify or extend the system
- What the impact of changes might be
- How different components interact
- Performance characteristics
- Security implications
- Best practices for working with this codebase

Read every file systematically like a new team member trying to understand the entire system. Focus on building deep, interconnected understanding rather than surface-level scanning.
